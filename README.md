I had a really simple deploy script sketched out for my personal website, but then found [Brian Levine's](https://github.com/balevine/jekyll-deploy) which was really nice.  So borrowed from that, particularly stdout suppression and error handling.  I wasn't really interested in building something agnostic and open-sourced like Brian, so I removed some of his extra scripts for config parsing and stashing.
